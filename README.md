Here, I've created an application designed to allow managers to generate a webpage that displays their team's basic info so that they have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

## Installation Requirements
[![8.3.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm%20version-8.3.1-blue)](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm/v/8.3.1)
  
  Enter the following command in the CLI: npm -install

 ## Usage
  Using Node.js in the command line, a manager is able to input employee's name, ID, email address, job title, and other pertinent information. The application then renders a js file to the dist folder that supplies the employee data and creates cards for each employee displaying their information. Be sure to copy over the icon folder, TeamProfile.html, profile.css, and cards-prod.js, all located in the dist folder. All files are necessary to create a well-designed, easy-to-use team profile.
